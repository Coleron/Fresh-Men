<h1>Jeddah Tower</h1>

<p>Overview<br><br>
 
Jeddah Economic City or Kingdom City is a unique urban development positioned on the north east coastline of Jeddah <br>
, Saudi Arabia, led by the Jeddah Economic Company. The designated land is over five million square meters in area  <br>
 and is aimed to become a smartly planned, multilayered network of business, tourism and recreational areas by 2026
<br><br><br>
 
Jeddah Tower<br>

Jeddah tower will become the CenterPoint of Jeddah Economic City and will erect to a record high <br>
 1000m. This “wonder of the world” will draw tourism to the city, whilst also functioning as a   <br>
 vertically integrated business area, residential area, commercial area, hotel and recreational area.<br>

 <p>Transportation networks<br>

Jeddah economic city will be an efficient city to commute through, as both a multifaceted <br>
underground metro system and an above ground light rail system will be installed.         <br>

 <p> Vertical transportation<br>
  
As Jeddah Tower and many of its neighbouring skyscrapers will be excessively tall, Jeddah economic <br>
  group and its design team have developed a vast network of maglev elevators that will be efficient in <br> 
  transporting not only people but also infrastructure vertically. <br>

 <p>Integration of Urban Space<br>
 
Jeddah tower and the city surrounding it will plan to use its space strategically to form multipurpose <br>
  areas that promote community interaction. <br>

 <p>Interactive Information<br>
 
Since Jeddah economic city will serve largely as a tourist destination, installations of interactive <br> 
  information interfaces will be scattered within public areas for guidance and convenience.         <br>

 <p>Creating a CBD.<br>
 
Jeddah currently does not have a Central Business Centre and most of its urban activity is scattered <br>
  amongst the city’s vast area. The creation of Jeddah Economic city will serve Jeddah as a new CBD, <br> 
  where people collectively and commonly interact with each over within a well-planned urban environment. <br>
