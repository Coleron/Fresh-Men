<h1>Sidewalk Labs</h1>


 <h2>Overview</h2>
 
 <p>
  
By Challenging urban growth with a vision to develop a smart city on the eastern waterfront <br>
  of Toronto’s shoreline, the project aims to redevelop Quayside, a 12 acre portion of Portland’s. <br>
  Sidewalk labs are developing a global hub of innovation for the local community by combining <br>
  technology, sustainability, mobility, affordability and economic opportunities in contribution with <br>
  the tri government agency and feedback from the locals.
<br><br><br>
 
<p>Sidewalk Toronto <br><br>
 
Quayside site area will be the development of a smart sustainable city and will be developed <br>
 in the next 10 years. Google decided that in order to create large infrastructure in the <br>
 span of a short development cycle is creating a virtual world for the people and a vision <br>
 for future developments in the surrounding areas. However as a smart city many articles and <br>
 communities see this future to be hazardous as the surrounding framework will be digitally accessed. <br>

 <p>A Connecting City.<br><br>
Quayside residing in Portland Toronto does not have an urban development scheme which is <br>
  on a massive scale of innovation and design. The plan to give the community of Toronto is to provide <br>
  a living of sustainability and efficiency by adopting advanced technology being applied to a new urban plan. <br>
  The populous being able to connect with businesses and everyday life creates an opportunity for <br>
  future developments and will start a new era of a smart urban development scheme. <br>
